# AlbertsVisuals

AlbertsVisuals goal is to generate a visual experience from video and audio data. The video is manipulated using oscillators and triggers (which take information from to audio FFT). The user has various settings to choose from that help tuning the response to one's liking.

As of now the project is not meant to be shared, so no getting started and setup is provided. sorry...
However I would like to change that in the near future...

Implementation of a web application is planed...
